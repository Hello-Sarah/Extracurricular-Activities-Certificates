In my undergraduate life, I wore many hats in different organizations—connecting my academic knowledge and experience to service. I was given the opportunity to explore my leadership capabilities as a member of IEEE BUPT Student Branch (2016-2018), helping organize four academic lectures. I was a commissary in charge of studies for the Information Security Major (2014-2015). I was part of the Ministry of Student Union of the School of Computer Science (2014-2015), saving thousands of dollars for the organization’s budget. I was also the President of Model United Nations Association of BUPT (2015) and a Delegate of Beijing Model United Nations (2015). 

I got involved with lots of volunteer work for the Volunteer Department of the School of Computer Science (2014) and the 60th Anniversary of BUPT (2015)—working as an exhibit interpreter in the university museum to assist more than 500 visitors who wished to learn more about the school. During the 35th Beijing Marathon (2015), I served water to more than 30,000 athletes. For the World Robot Conference (2016) and the Global Artificial Intelligence Technology Conference (2017), I helped the event coordinators arrange and prepare the venues, offered my translation services to the foreign guests, and led 50 volunteers. In Yunnan Province (Chicago) Overseas Talents Seminar (2018), I assisted 30 guests from China and helped organize the activity.

Community service, volunteer work, and extracurricular activities have given me a greater sense of meaning. Contributing to society, helping others, and creating real change have allowed me to learn more about myself, explore new interests, and maintain a balanced life. I feel fortunate that my colleagues and numerous industry leaders and experts have appreciated my work and spoke highly of me. These experiences have strengthened by commitment to building civic awareness, honing my management and leadership abilities, and developing interpersonal communication skills. I believe that such characteristics will prove valuable in my journey to become an effective data scientist.
